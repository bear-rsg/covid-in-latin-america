"The map on this page locates some of the literary responses to Covid-19 in "
"Latin America we have identified on social media and other digital "
"platforms. Our focus is on texts in Spanish produced or circulated during "
"the first two years of the health crisis. We aim to showcase how the "
"pandemic was narrated in real-time, when it was happening; that is, before "
"the inevitable hindsight perspective took hold and blurred our collective "
"memory. The “connections” option traces the transnational character of the "
"literary life that vigorously developed —centred in Latin America— when the "
"virus was spreading throughout the world. As is the case with most archives, "
"this online repository is incomplete. We will continue adding data as we "
"find it and obtain permission to show it. The incompleteness, however, also "
"functions as a poetic reminder of the time of Covid-19 and the many empty "
"spaces it left."
